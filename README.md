# game_of_thrones
Data driven analysis of the highs and lows of the TV show game of thrones 

* I used the game of thrones dataset downloaded from kaggle.com to make some inferences about it.
* From the raw dataset, I deleted some missing values that are irrelevant and cleaned the data to get a cleaner version to plot. 
* I narrowed down the data for the highest & lowest rated episodes, the episodes derived from various novel adaptation, information about specific directors and their episodes, viewership, etc.
* I used the PANDAS and MATPLOTLIB library of Python to plot the graph through Jupyter notebooks to connect to the data source.
